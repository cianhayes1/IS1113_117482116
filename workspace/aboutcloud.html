  <h4>Software As A Service (Salesforce)</h4>
  <img src="salesforce.png" alt ="salesforce" style= "height:50%;width:50%">
  <p>
    Software as a Service or SaaS is a way of delivering applications 
  over the Internet, as a service. Also known as cloud software,
  ASP, on-demand software or hosted software. The first applications 
  for consumers were things like webmail, bookmarking and photo sharing.
  In business, things like recruitment, expenses and customer 
  relationship management were among the early innovations. 
  SaaS has since become a widely-used business model with more 
  and more different kinds of applications available via the cloud.

  <h4>Platform As A Service (Cloud9)</h4>
  <img src="cloud9.png" alt ="cloud9" style= "height:50%;width:50%">
  <p>
   Platform as a Service (PaaS) or application platform as a Service (aPaaS) or 
   platform base service is a category of cloud computing services that provides
   a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without 
   the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically 
   associated with developing and launching an app.PaaS can be delivered 
   in three ways: as a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer 
   controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the 
   provider provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system (OS), 
   middleware (e.g. Java runtime, .NET runtime, integration, etc.), database 
   and other services to host the consumer's application; as a private service 
   (software or appliance) inside the firewall; or as software deployed on a 
   public infrastructure as a service.

  <h4>Infrastructure As A Service (Amazon Web Services)</h4>
  <img src= "amazonwebservices.png" alt ="aws" style= "height:50%;width:50%;text-align:center;">
  <p>
   Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide 
   high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying 
   network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, 
   data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A hypervisor, such as Xen, 
   Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, or Hyper-V, LXD, runs the 
   virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational 
   system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale 
   services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. 
   Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single Linux kernel 
   running directly on the physical hardware. Linux cgroups and namespaces 
   are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and 
   manage the containers.
